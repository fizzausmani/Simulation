# Simulation

These codes simulate biomemetic membrane systems.

The 'terminal versions' time-advance the particles and produce velocity fields and the position and orientation evolution of the particles.
Visualization should be done using the Animations and Plotting script.
The concentration field advection is performed using the 'Advection-Diffusion...' code; the mixing norm is calculated using the mix norm code.
The files for each Saffman length need to be saved in one location for the mix norm code.
